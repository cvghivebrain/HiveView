# HiveView

HiveView is an image viewer that can (potentially) open any image file, either by using the built-in customisable raw image viewer, or using external programs to preconvert images to PNG. Image format definitions can be added to HiveView.ini. See [FORMATS.md](FORMATS.md) for a list of currently supported formats.

## Adding formats
### Raw uncompressed raster images

### Converting with external programs

### Converting with batch files
